Conjunction elimination
In propositional logic, conjunction elimination (also called and elimination, ? elimination,[1] or simplification)[2][3][4] is a valid immediate inference, argument form and rule of inference which makes the inference that, if the conjunction A and B is true, then A is true, and B is true. The rule makes it possible to shorten longer proofs by deriving one of the conjuncts of a conjunction on a line by itself.
An example in English:
It's raining and it's pouring. 
Therefore it's raining. 
The rule consists of two separate sub-rules, which can be expressed in formal language as:
P ? Q ? P {\displaystyle {\frac {P\land Q}{\therefore P}}}  
and
P ? Q ? Q {\displaystyle {\frac {P\land Q}{\therefore Q}}}  
The two sub-rules together mean that, whenever an instance of " P ? Q {\displaystyle P\land Q} " appears on a line of a proof, either " P {\displaystyle P} " or " Q {\displaystyle Q} " can be placed on a subsequent line by itself. The above example in English is an application of the first sub-rule.
Formal notation
The conjunction elimination sub-rules may be written in sequent notation:
( P ? Q ) ? P {\displaystyle (P\land Q)\vdash P}  
and
( P ? Q ) ? Q {\displaystyle (P\land Q)\vdash Q}  
where ? {\displaystyle \vdash }  is a metalogical symbol meaning that P {\displaystyle P}  is a syntactic consequence of P ? Q {\displaystyle P\land Q}  and Q {\displaystyle Q}  is also a syntactic consequence of P ? Q {\displaystyle P\land Q}  in logical system;
and expressed as truth-functional tautologies or theorems of propositional logic:
( P ? Q ) ? P {\displaystyle (P\land Q)\to P}  
and
( P ? Q ) ? Q {\displaystyle (P\land Q)\to Q}  
where P {\displaystyle P}  and Q {\displaystyle Q}  are propositions expressed in some formal system.
