Conjunction introduction
Conjunction introduction (often abbreviated simply as conjunction and also called and introduction[1][2][3]) is a valid rule of inference of propositional logic. The rule makes it possible to introduce a conjunction into a logical proof. It is the inference that if the proposition p is true, and proposition q is true, then the logical conjunction of the two propositions p and q is true. For example, if it's true that it's coming, and it's true that I'm inside, then it's true that "it's coming and I'm inside". The rule can be stated:
P , Q ? P ? Q {\displaystyle {\frac {P,Q}{\therefore P\land Q}}}  
where the rule is that wherever an instance of " P {\displaystyle P} " and " Q {\displaystyle Q} " appear on lines of a proof, a " P ? Q {\displaystyle P\land Q} " can be placed on a subsequent line.
Formal notation
The conjunction introduction rule may be written in sequent notation:
P , Q ? P ? Q {\displaystyle P,Q\vdash P\land Q}  
where ? {\displaystyle \vdash }  is a metalogical symbol meaning that P ? Q {\displaystyle P\land Q}  is a syntactic consequence if P {\displaystyle P}  and Q {\displaystyle Q}  are each on lines of a proof in some logical system;
where P {\displaystyle P}  and Q {\displaystyle Q}  are propositions expressed in some formal system.
